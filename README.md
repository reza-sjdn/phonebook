# phonebook
my first C++ project - Phonebook  
Hey! This is my first sort of useful project written in C++. 
I used my knowledge from Deitel's book that is How To Program C++. 
This phonebook does 5 main jobs. Add, Remove, Edit, List and Find contacts. 
Of course it is not so mature and it's obvious 'cause i'm not so mature in C++. 
But i try to add more power to it when i learn new things.
